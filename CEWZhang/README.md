This file contains:
1. myproject: The file contain every code (.php, .css, .js) to implement College Event Website Application. It also has vendor file. The HP.jpg is the homepage image. The dbscript.sql is the setting sql code.
2. Project Report: Detailed report for this app.

Software installation: 
You can install a Wamp to run this project. After you set up the Wamp, start it, find the www directory in wamp64 (default) file and place the folder "myproject" wihtin it. 

Run: 
Open your browser (Chrome, Firefox, Microsoft Edge, etc.), navigate to the url: localhost/phpmyadmin, and copy/import the dbscript.sql that contains in the myproject file. Then navigate to: localhost/myproject, you will see the homepage of College Event Website Application. If you want to check database after you add some new, navigate back to: localhost/phpmyadmin/. I recommend to create some virtual hosts as the test user, so you can see the change on each user's interface after you control another user to effect the condition (ex. after create event, the other users can see this event).
